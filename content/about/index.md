## Who am I?

<img src="/img/main/whoami.png">

I'm definitely not Derek Zoolander... unfortunately. 

My name is Jacob and I'm electrical engineer and software developer.

8BitOctave is a blog of my interests and projects related to electrical engineering, software development, music and anything else I feel the government should know about me. 

I currently live in southern California and work within the medical device industry.

## History 

I'm originally from New Mexico, where I grew up playing a lot of sports and gorging myself on christmas style burritos.

Through highschool I played basketball and also did track and field. By the end of highschool I was fortunate enough to have landed a scholarship to play basketball at Colorado School of Mines where I pursued electrical engineering.

As I made my way through college I found an interest in embedded systems. The idea of being able to program a board or controller and have it respond real time to you has always fascinated me. With that interest I found myself working at Seagate Technologies working on printed circuit board designs for hard disc drives.
