Big milestone to get this up and running. 

In case you're curious, this website is powered off of Hugo static site generator. There are a series of youtube videos out there to follow along with, but I coupled this with Netlify/Github to build and launch the website. Definitely recommend if you're technically savvy and want a website hosted for free!
