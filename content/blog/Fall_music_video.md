### Why ASK? Because their sound is as unique as their background

If you're looking for a new sound with elements of punk, rap, and jazz, be sure to ASK (<a href="https://allsystemsknow.bandcamp.com/album/i-o">All Systems Know</a>). These guys are based out of Los Angelas, CA and carry atypical musican day jobs. Theatre production and lighting design, contract placement for Google/Youtube, and political policy analysis just a few to mention. On top of maintaining a heavy day to day workload they have also output two albums (<i><a href="https://allsystemsknow.bandcamp.com/album/division">Division</a> </i> and <i> <a href="https://allsystemsknow.bandcamp.com/album/i-o">I/O</a> </i>) one single (<i><a href="https://allsystemsknow.bandcamp.com/track/zen-den">Zen/Den</a> </i>). My two favorite songs are The Fall (obviously) and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uB6aSgAlss">Storm on Saturn</a>.

### Hold me closer tiny dancer

One of my favorite movies of all time is <i> Step Up </I>, starring Channing Tatum and Jenna Dewan. I didn't see this movie until 2015, almost a full decade after it's release. I remember thinking how cool it was even at the age of 26. Now to be clear, the storytelling and timeline isn't the best but that will be spared here. What is great is the mixture of hip hop, breakdancing, and ballet technicality that both Channing and Jenna execute. Hands down a huge inspiration for my style of dance.

Another inspiration of mine is James Syme. After moving to San Diego in November 2018, one of my goals was to pursue dancing as a side hustle just as James was doing with <i> All Systems Know </i>. In November of 2019, James gave me a call and asked about the possibilty of me choreographing and dancing in one of their music videos.

I immediately called one of my good friends and dance colleagues, Leah Osborne. Just like that we were committed to a video shoot in January of 2020. 

I present <b> <i> The Fall </b> </i> official music video. Enjoy!

###  Learning Points

Leah and I both had a similar goal with dance; be in or create a music/dance video. Neither of us had formally choreographed a project in this capacity but we sure thought about it a lot. What I hadn't thought about were some of the challenges:
##### Your intention can be good, but the idea can suck
My brain loves to tell me the dance moves in my head are great. In reality, when I try to translate a dance move in my head to physical motion it doesn't carry the same "cool" feeling it did when I was dreaming about it. Although it doesn't feel cool on the outside it shouldn't stop you from trying. 

##### Always allow an expression to take place, even though you may never use it
To me, coming up with choreography is the same as improvising on the piano. Everyone oohhs and aahhs when it's polished and at rhythm but the truth is it takes a lot of time "playing" to get there. The process of "playing" should be one of openness and non-judgement. Even deeper, "playing" should be an exploration of your emotional state and being. 

If there is a dance move or physical motion needing expression, do it. Only after it's been voiced should you decide on whether to take it or leave it. Even more important is listening to your dance partner. If they have an idea, provide them a space to explore it even if they don't feel sold on it themselves. At least this way you have all of the information on the table to make a call.

##### Statistics & Tracking

During this project I wanted to monitor a few things: film the output of each practice session for reflection and track time spent in the creative process.

<b> Overall Project Dates: Dec. 18th - January 19th 2020 </b>

  Activity | Hours
--------|------
Song Study | 1.5-2
Rehearsal | 26
Performance | 6


Overall, I'm very pleased with how the choreography and execution turned out. I can officially say I was in a music video as a dancer and the learnings from this creative process will be sure to carry over to those in the future. 

Lastly a huge thanks to All Systems Know for the opportunity to be in this video. A big shout to Dennis Peraza for the production, and my dance partner Leah Osborne for being supportive and encouraging through the creative process.
