First animated logo project to support my friend's band, All Systems Know. 

I used a plug-in called <a href="https://www.videocopilot.net/blog/2016/03/new-plug-in-saber-now-available-100-free/">Saber</a>, provided by Video Copilot. What I like about this effect is the Stranger Things vibe it gives out. The 3D rotating characters also gave it a nice futuristic, movie title sense and the timing of effects is pleasing to me. 

Hopefully more projects to come!
