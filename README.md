# 8bitoctave - Portfolio Website

## Description
This is a personal website of all engineering, animation/motion graphics, music, dance, and psychology projects I hope to pursue.

I started this site during 2020 to be a placeholder for all my interests, previous work to look back on, and a way to showcase work for anyone interested. 

Hope you enjoy.
